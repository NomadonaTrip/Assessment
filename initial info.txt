Based on the cumulative insights from your answers, we'll provide a recommendation that best aligns with your business's online objectives and operational style. For example, if your answers frequently indicate simple informational needs and infrequent updates, a static website might be recommended. If you highlight complex functionalities or a need for custom solutions, engaging a web developer will likely be suggested. If you're using a dynamic platform but struggling with content, a content manager could be your ideal solution. If your current setup perfectly matches your active needs, continuing with your current solution might be the best path.",
